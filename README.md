# NGINX task

### TLDR research aka what I needed to even start

Nginx -> high performance software efficient under heavy load, event driven arch, can function as a web server, reverse proxy with load balancer, cache etc. -> those are configurable<br>
Forward vs Reverse proxy -> acts on behalf of the client, eg. VPN that hides client IP vs acts on behalf of the server, eg. reverse proxy with load balancing, caching etc.<br>

# High level questions to answer

Why did we choose to solve it this way?<br>
What did we get stuck at, how did we overcome it? How could it be solved differently? -> Started with almost no knowledge of some terms, learnt it <br>
How would the solution scale?<br>
Performance, code maintainability, security...<br>
What parts of the solution are optimal, which are not?<br>
What could be improved and why not improve it straight up?<br>
How long did the task take? (research, implementation, debug)<br>
How did we think about the task?<br>
What did we come up with and what did we threw away?<br>
What would we do if it went to production? -> Proper testing has already taken place on a pre-prod environemnt<br>
